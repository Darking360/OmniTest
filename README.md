# OmniTest - Basic Auth API

Basic Auth API built with Express and MongoDB, with documentation thanks to Swagger engine.

## Getting Started

First you'll need to clone the repository into your local machine, then follow the next instructions.

### Prerequisites

You'll need MongoDB and NodeJS installed in order to run the project, as well as Swagger, also for testing the API I highly recommend Postman.

In order to install Swagger you only need to:

```
npm install -g swagger
```

In order to install MongoDB and NodeJS you can check the official websites for both projects.

### Installing

Now that you have the repository, please install all the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

In order to download Express and other tools in order to run the project.

Then run MongoDB from the terminal with:

```
mongod
```

After that, all you need to do is run:

```
swagger project start
```

Now that's everything and you have a local copy of the project that can be tested with Postman.
